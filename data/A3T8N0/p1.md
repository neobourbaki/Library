For $n=1$, the length of the segment is simply 2.

For $n=2$, the area is computed by 

$$
\int_{-1}^1 2 \sqrt(1-x^2)\,dx = \pi 
$$

For $n=3$, the volume is 

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \pi (1-x^2)\,dx = \frac{4\pi}{3} 
$$

with the integrand being the area of a disk with radius $\sqrt{1-x^2}$.

For $n=4$, the 4-dimensional volume is 

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \frac{4\pi}{3} (1-x^2)^{3/2}\,dx = 
$$
