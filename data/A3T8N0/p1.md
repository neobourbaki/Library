As the dependence on radius $r$ must be in accord with the dimension, we may
take $r=1$ without loss of generality.

For $n=1$, the length of the segment $\\{x\in\mathbf R \\,|\\, |x|\leq 1\\}$ is 2.

For $n=2$, the area of the circle is computed by 

$$
\int_{-1}^1 2 \sqrt{1-x^2}\\,dx = 4 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos^2(\theta)\\, d\theta = \pi 
$$

For $n=3$, the volume of the sphere is 

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \pi (1-x^2)\\,dx = \frac{4\pi}{3} 
$$

with the integrand being the area of a disk with radius $\sqrt{1-x^2}$.

For $n=4$, the 4-dimensional volume is 

$$
\int_{-1}^1 \frac{4\pi}{3} \left(1-x^2\right)^{3/2}\\,dx = \frac{8\pi}{3} \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos^4(\theta)\\,d\theta =
$$
