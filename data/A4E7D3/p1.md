Assume $a<b$. Let $(a=a_0<a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_n=b)$ be a partition,
and by the mean value theorem, we have on each subinterval $[a_i, a_{i+1}]$,

$$
f(a_{i+1})-f(a_i) = f'(\xi_i)\\, (a_{i+1}-a_i)
$$

for some $\xi_i\in (a_i, a_{i+1})$. It follows then that

\begin{aligned}
f(b)-f(a) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(a_{i+1}) - f(a_i) \\\\
&= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f'(\xi_i)\\, (a_{i+1}-a_i)
\end{aligned}

In the limit of the partition becoming infinitely fine, the right hand side
approaches the integral

$$
\int_a^b f'(x)\\,dx
$$

by the continuity of $f'$. A slight complication comes in when $I$ includes one  
or both of its endpoints, and $f'$ fails to exist there.
