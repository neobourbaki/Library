Let 

$$
g(x) := f(x) - \int_a^x f'(t)\\,dt 
$$

as a function of $x\in I$, with $a$ fixed. It is enough to 
show that $g$ is constant on $I$, for then 

$$
g(b) = g(a) = f(a) - 0
$$

for any $b\in I$. Indeed, by another Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,

$$
g'(x) = f'(x) - \frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f'(t)\\,dt = f'(x) - f'(x) = 0
$$

at any $x\in I$, and an application of the mean value theorem 
implies that $g$ must be constant. Indeed, for any two points $a<b$ of $I$,
there exists $\xi\in (a,b)$ such that

$$
g(a) - g(b) = g'(\xi)\\, (b-a) = 0
$$

which is precisely what $g$ being constant means.
