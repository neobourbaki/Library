Let 

$$
g(x) := f(x) - \int_a^x f'(t)\\,dt 
$$

as a function of $x\in I$, with $a$ fixed. By continuity of $f'$, the function
$g$ is well-defined. It is enough to show that $g$ is constant on $I$, for then 

$$
g(b) = g(a) = f(a) - 0
$$

as claimed. Indeed, by another Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,

$$
g'(x) = f'(x) - \frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f'(t)\\,dt = f'(x) - f'(x) = 0
$$

at any $x\in I$, and by the mean value theorem, there exists
$\xi$ between $a$ and any $b\in I$ such that

$$
g(b) - g(a) = g'(\xi)\\, (b-a) = 0
$$

which means that $g$ is constant on $I$.
