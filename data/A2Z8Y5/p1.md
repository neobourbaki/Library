If $f$ is constant, then 

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = f(\xi)\\,(b-a) 
$$

for all $\xi$. Now assume that $f$ is not constant, then $f$ must assume 
a value greater, and another value less, than the mean value

$$
M = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx
$$

of $f$, somewhere on the interval $(a,b)$. By the intermediate value theorem, 
$f$ must assume the mean value $M$ in between those two points.
