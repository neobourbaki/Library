Let $f: [a, b]\to\mathbb R$ be a continuous function on a closed interval 
$[a, b]\subset\mathbb R$, and suppose that $f', f'', \ldots, f^{(n-1)}$ exist
and are continuous on $[a, b]$, and that $f^{(n)}$ exists on $(a, b)$, then 
there exists $\xi\in (a, b)$ such that

$$
f(b) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(b-a)^k + 
\frac{f^{(n)}(\xi)}{n!}(b-a)^n .
$$
