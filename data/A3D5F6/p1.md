By definition of the derivative, we need to prove that 

$$
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h} f(t)\,dt = f(x)
$$

Indeed, by continuity of $f(t)$ (at the fixed point $x$), for 
any $\epsilon>0$ we may choose $\delta$ such that

$$
f(x) - \epsilon < f(t) < f(x) + \epsilon
$$

for $|t-x|<\delta$. Integrating $f(t)$ from $x$ to $x+h$, with $ 0 < h < \delta $, 
we have

$$
(f(x)-\epsilon)\, h < \int_x^{x+h} f(t)\,dt < (f(x)+\epsilon)\, h
$$

which implies that

$$
\left| \frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h} f(t)\,dt - f(x) \right| < \epsilon
$$

Similarly for the integral from $x$ to $x-h$.
