\begin{theorem}
(Newton-Leibniz) Let $f:I\to \RR$ be a continuous function on an 
interval $I\in \RR$. Then the function
$$
F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt
$$
(with $a\in I$ fixed) is differentiable on $I$, and  
$$
F'(x) = f(x)
$$
for all $x\in I$. If any boundary point of $I$ is in $I$, the 
derivative of $F$ at that point is understood to be one-sided 
derivative.
