\begin{theorem}
(Newton-Leibniz) Let ${f:I\to \RR} be a continuous function on an 
interval $I\in \RR$. Then the function
$$
F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt
$$
(with $a\in I$ fixed) is differentiable on the interior of $I$, with 
$$
F'(x) = f(x).
$$
Furthermore, $F$ is continuous at the boundary points of $I$, if any.
\end{theorem}
