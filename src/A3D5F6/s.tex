\begin{theorem}
(Newton-Leibniz) Let ${f:I\to \RR} be a continuous function on an 
interval $I\in \RR$. Then the function
$$
F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt
$$
(with $a\in I$ fixed) is differentiable on the interior of $I$, with 
$$
F'(x) = f(x).
$$
Furthermore, if any of the endpoints of $I$ is in $I$, the one-sided 
derivative exists, and is equal to the value of $f$ at that point. 
In particular, $F$ is continuous there too.
