\begin{proof}

Consider the two sides of 
$$
f(b) = f(a) + \int_a^b f'(x)\,dx 
$$
as functions of $b\in I$, with $a$ fixed.

To establish the equality of the two functions, we shall only 
need that
\begin{enumerate}
\item they are equal at a single point;
\item they are differentiable, and the derivatives are equal 
for all $b$ in the interior of $I$;
\end{enumerate}
as a consequence of the mean value theorem.

Indeed, (1) is immediate: the two sides are equal at $b=a$; 
and (2) follows from 
$$
\frac{d}{db}\int_a^b g(x)\,dx = g(b)
$$
for any continuous function $g$, which is also known as 
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

\end{proof}
