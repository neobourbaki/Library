\begin{proof}

Let $y\in [a,b]$, and consider the more general statement
$$
f(y) = f(a) + \int_a^y f'(x)\,dx 
$$
and regard both sides as functions of $y$, with $a$ fixed.

To establish the equality for all $y$, we shall only need
\begin{enumerate}
\item the two sides are equal at a single point;
\item they are differentiable, and the derivatives are equal 
for all $y\in (a,b)$;
\end{enumerate}
as a consequence of the mean value theorem.

1) is immediate: the two sides are equal at $y=a$;

2) is also known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, namely
$$
\frac{d}{dy}\int_a^y f'(x)\,dx = f'(y)
$$

\end{proof}
