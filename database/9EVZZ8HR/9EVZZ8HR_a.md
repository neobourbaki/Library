The *dual* of a vector space $V$ over a field $k$ is the $k$-vector space $V^*$ of all linear maps $V \to k$, with addition and scalar multiplication defined by

- $(\phi + \psi)(v) = \phi(v) + \psi(v)$
- $(\alpha \phi)(v) = \alpha \phi(v)$

for all $v \in V$, $\phi, \psi \in V^*$, and $\alpha \in k$. The value $\phi(v)$ is also denoted $\langle \phi, v \rangle$, and may be referred to as the (natural) *pairing* of $V^*$ and $V$.
