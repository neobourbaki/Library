Let $\phi: X \to Y$ (i.e., $\phi \in \mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(X, Y)$) be a morphism in a category $\mathcal{C}$. The *kernel* of $\phi$ is an object $K$, together with a morphism $k: K \to X$, such that $\phi \circ k = 0$ in $\mathrm{Mor}_{\mathcal{C}}(K, Y)$, and is universal in the sense that 

- if $K'$ is another such object with $k': K' \to X$, there is a morphism $K' \to K$ that commutes with all the relevant morphisms.
