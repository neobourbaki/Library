A function $f: U \to \mathbb{C}$ on a domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is *differentiable at* $z_0 \in U$ if the limit

$$
\lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0}
$$

exists (in $\mathbb{C}$), and the limit is called the *derivative of* $f$ at $z_0$, denoted $f'(z_0)$. We say $f$ is *differentiable* if it is differentiable at all $z_0 \in U$, and the *derivative* $f$ is a function $U \to \mathbb{C}$.
