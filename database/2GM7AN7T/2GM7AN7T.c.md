A *vector* over a field $k$ is a $n$-tuple of elements of $k$, and the set of all vectors, with the natural addition and scalar multiplication, is a *vector space* over $k$ of dimension $n$.

In general, a *vector* of arbitrary dimension $I$ ($I$ a cardinal number) is an $I$-tuple, i.e., a map $I \to k$ that is zero except for finitely many $i \in I$. The *vector space* over $k$ of dimension $I$ is the set of all such vectors, with the natural addition and scalar multiplication.
