For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a *vector* over a division ring $k$ is a $n$-tuple of elements of $k$,

$$
v = [a_1, \ldots, a_n] \in k^n
$$

and the set of all such vectors, with the natural addition and scalar multiplication (from the left), is a *vector space* over $k$ of dimension $n$.

In general, a *vector* of arbitrary dimension $I$ ($I$ a cardinal number) is an $I$-tuple, i.e., a map $I \to k$ that is zero except for finitely many $i \in I$. The *vector space* over $k$ of dimension $I$ is the set of all such vectors, with the natural addition and scalar multiplication.
