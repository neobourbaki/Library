A map $L: M_1 \times M_2 \to N$, where $M_1$, $M_2$, and $N$ are modules over a commutative ring $R$, is *bilinear* if it is linear in each factor, i.e., for each $m_1 \in M_1$, $m_2 \mapsto L(m_1, m_2)$ is linear, and for each $m_2 \in M_2$, $m_1 \mapsto L(m_1, m_2)$ is linear. In general, a map $L: M_1 \times \cdots \times M_n \to N$ is *multilinear* if it is linear in each factor $M_i$.
