A map $L: M_1 \times M_2 \to N$ of modules $M_1$, $M_2$, and $N$ over a commutative ring $R$ is *bilinear* (or $R$-*bilinear*) if it is linear in each factor, i.e., for each $m_1 \in M_1$, $m_2 \mapsto L(m_1, m_2)$ is linear, and for each $m_2 \in M_2$, $m_1 \mapsto L(m_1, m_2)$ is linear. In general, a map $L: M_1 \times \cdots \times M_n \to N$ is *multilinear* (or $R$-*multilinear*) if it is linear in each factor $M_i$.
