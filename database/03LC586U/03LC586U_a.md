A map $L: V_1 \times V_2 \to W$, where $V_1$, $V_2$, and $W$ are vector spaces over a field $k$, is *bilinear* if it is linear in each factor, i.e., for each $v_1 \in V_1$, $v_2 \mapsto L(v_1, v_2)$ is linear, and for each $v_2 \in V_2$, $v_1 \mapsto L(v_1, v_2)$ is linear. In general, a map $L: V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n \to W$ is *multilinear* if it is linear in each factor $V_i$.
