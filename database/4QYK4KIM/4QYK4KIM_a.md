The *Lie algebra* of a Lie group $G$ (over the real numbers) is the tangent space $\mathfrak{g} = T_1 G$ at the identity $1 \in G$, equipped with the Lie bracket $[X, Y]$ given by

$$
[X, Y] = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{\exp(\epsilon X) \exp(\epsilon Y) \exp(-\epsilon X) \exp(-\epsilon Y) - 1}{\epsilon^2}.
$$

where $\exp: \mathfrak{g} \to G$ is the exponential map.
