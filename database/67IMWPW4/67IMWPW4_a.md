A *commutative ring* is an abelian group $(R, +)$, together with a binary operation $R \times R \to R$, $(r, s) \mapsto rs$ (called *multiplication*) satisfying

- $rs = sr$ for all $r, s \in R$;
- $(r+s)t = rt + st$ for all $r, s, t \in R$;
- there exists a multiplicative identity, i.e., $1 \in R$ such that $1r = r$ for all $r \in R$.
