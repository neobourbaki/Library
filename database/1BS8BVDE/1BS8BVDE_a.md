A function $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ on an interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a *step function* if there exists a (finite) partition of $I$ such that $f$ is constant on each subinterval. In other words, with the partition $(a = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_n = b)$ of $I = (a, b)$, 

$$
f(x) = y_i, \qquad a_i < x < a_{i+1}
$$

for some constant $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$.
