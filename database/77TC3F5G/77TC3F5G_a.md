A representation $V$ of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over a field $k$ is *semisimple* (or *completely reducible*) if every proper subrepresentation has a complement, i.e., for every subrepresentation $V_1 \subset V$, there exists a representation $V_2$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ such that $V \cong V_1 \oplus V_2$ (direct sum of representations of $\mathfrak{g}$).
