Let $X$ be a topological space, and $A$ a module over a ring $R$. The $n$-*th* (singular) *homology* of $X$ with coefficients in $A$ is the quotient $R$-module

$$
H_n(X, A) := \mathrm{Ker}(\partial_n: C_{n} \to C_{n-1}) / \mathrm{Im}(\partial_{n+1}: C_{n+1} \to C_{n})
$$

where 

- $C_n = C_n(R) \otimes A$;
- $C_n(R)$ is the free $R$-module generated by the continuous maps $\Delta_n \to X$ (elements of $C_n$ are called *chains*);
- $\Delta_n := \\{ (x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\; : \\; x_i \geq 0 \text{ for each }i, \text{ and } \sum_i x_i = 1 \\}$;
- $\partial_n: C_n \to C_{n-1}$ is the boundary map given by

$$
\partial_n(\sigma) = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \sigma(x_0, \ldots, \hat{x}_i, \ldots, x_n)
$$

for each $\sigma: \Delta_n \to X$ (where $\hat{x}_i$ means the coordinate $x_i$ is ommited).

For $A = \mathbb{Z}$ (as a module over itself), $H_n(X, \mathbb{Z})$ is known as the $n$-*th* (singular) *homology group* of $X$, and is simply denoted $H_n(X)$.
