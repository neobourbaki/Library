(Weyl's character formula) Let $(V, \pi)$ be a finite-dimensional irreducible representaion of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and let $\mathfrak{h}$ be a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. The character $\chi_V: \mathfrak{h} \to \mathbb{C}$ is given by

$$
\chi_V(H) = \frac{\sum_{w\in W} \varepsilon(w) e^{w(\lambda+\rho)(H)}}{\prod_{\alpha\in\Delta^+} e^{\alpha(H)/2} - e^{-\alpha(H)/2}}
$$

where

- $W$ is the Weyl group;
- $\Delta^+$ is a set of positive roots of the root system $\Delta \subset \mathfrak{h}^*$;
- $\rho$ is half of the sum of the positive roots;
- $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is the highest weight of the irreducible representation $V$;
- $\varepsilon: W \to \\{\pm 1\\}$ is the sign, given by $(-1)^{\ell(w)}$ where $\ell(w)$ is the (smallest) number of simple reflections in $w$.
