(Weyl's character formula) Let $(V, \pi)$ be a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and let $\mathfrak{h}$ be a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. The character $\chi_V: \mathfrak{h} \to \mathbb{C}$ of the representation is given by

$$
\chi_V(X) = \frac{\sum_{w\in W} \varepsilon(w) e^{\langle w(\lambda+\rho), X\rangle}}{\prod_{\alpha\in\Phi^+} e^{\langle \alpha, X \rangle/2} - e^{-\langle \alpha, X\rangle/2}}
$$

where

- $W$ is the Weyl group;
- $\Phi^+$ is the set of positive roots of the root system $\Phi \subset \mathfrak{h}^*$;
- $\rho$ is half of the sum of the positive roots;
- $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is the highest weight of the representation;
- $\varepsilon: W \to \\{\pm 1\\}$ is the sign homomorphism, given by $\varepsilon(s_\alpha)=-1$ for simple roots $\alpha\in\Phi^+$.
