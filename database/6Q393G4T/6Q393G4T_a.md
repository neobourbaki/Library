The *sine* of a real number $x \in [0, \pi/2]$ is half the chord in the unit circle that cuts the circle in an arc of measure $2x$. For other values of $x \in \mathbb{R}$, the sine of $x$ is defined by extending using the relations

$$
\sin(x) = \sin(-x)
$$

$$
\sin(x) = \sin(\pi - x)
$$

for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
