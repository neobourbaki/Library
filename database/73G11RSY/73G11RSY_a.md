The union of two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ is the set $S_1 \cap S_2$ of elements that are either members of $S_1$ or members of $S_2$. 

For an arbitrary collection of sets $S_i$, the union of $S_i$, denoted $\cap_i U_i$, is the set of elements that are members of some $S_i$, i.e., elements $x$ such that there exists $i$ such that $x \in S_i$.
