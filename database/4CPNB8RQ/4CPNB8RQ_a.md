Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, and $x$ an object in $\mathcal{C}$. The *automorphism group* of $x \in \mathcal{C}$, denoted $\mathrm{Aut}_{\mathcal{C}}(x)$, is the set of all isomorphisms $x \to x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, with the composition of morphisms as the multiplication.

An element of the automorphism group is called an *automorphism*.
