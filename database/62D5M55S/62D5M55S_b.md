The *limit* of a sequence $x_n \in k$, $n=1,2,\ldots$, in a normed field $k$ is said to *exist*, and *is equal to* $x \in k$, if every open ball $B(x, \epsilon)$ centered at $x$ contains all but finitely many $x_n$'s. One writes 

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = x
$$

or

$$
x_n \to x \qquad \text{as} \qquad n \to \infty.
$$
