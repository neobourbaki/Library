An *abelian group* is a set $G$, together with a binary operation $G\times G\to G$, $(g, h)\mapsto g+h$ (called the *group law* or *addition*) such that

- (commutativity) $g + h = h + g$ for all $g, h \in G$;
- (associativity) $g + (h + k) = (g + h) + k$ for all $g, h, k \in G$;
- there exists an *identity* $e\in G$, i.e., $g + e = e + g = g$ for all $g\in G$;
- for any $g \in G$, there exists an $h\in G$ such that $g + h = h + g = e$ ($h$ is known as the *inverse* to $g$, and is denoted $-g$).
