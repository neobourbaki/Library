An (associative) *algebra* over a field $k$ is a $k$-vector space $A$, together with a bilinear operation $A \times A \to A$ that makes $A$ a ring (with unity $1_A$), such that the scalar multiplication $k \times A \to A$ satisfies $1_k 1_A = 1_A$. In other words, the scalar multiplication is given by the composition of the (unique) ring homomorphism $k \to A$, $\alpha \mapsto \alpha 1_A$ with multiplication in $A$.
