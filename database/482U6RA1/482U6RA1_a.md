An (associative) *algebra* over a field $k$ is a $k$-vector space $A$, together with a bilinear operation $A \times A \to A$ that makes $A$ a ring, such that the scalar multiplication $k \times A \to A$ satisfies $1_k 1_A = 1_A$. In other words, there is a ring homomorphism $k \to A$ that takes $1_k \mapsto 1_A$.
