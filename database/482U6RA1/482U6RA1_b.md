An (associative) *algebra* over a (commutative) ring $R$ is a $R$-module $M$, together with a bilinear operation $M \times M \to M$ that makes $M$ a ring (with unity $1_M$), such that the scalar multiplication $R \times M \to M$ satisfies $1_R 1_M = 1_M$. In other words, the scalar multiplication is given by the composition of the (unique) ring homomorphism $R \to M$, $r \mapsto r1_M$ with multiplication in $M$.
