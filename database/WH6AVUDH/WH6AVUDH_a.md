Let

$$
f(x) = \sin^{-1}(x) \\;, \qquad -1 \leq x \leq 1
$$

which is continuous on $[-1, 1]$, and differentiable on $(-1, 1)$ with

$$
f'(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
$$

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus yields

$$
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \sin^{-1}(1) - \sin^{-1}(0) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
$$
