The *group algebra* of a group $G$ over a field $k$ is the $k$-vector space $kG = k^{\oplus G}$ generated by $G$, i.e., the space of (formal) finite sums

$$
\sum_{g \in G} a_g e_g
$$

with coefficients $a_g \in k$, all but finitely many of which are zero, with the product on $kG$ given by

$$
e_g e_h = e_{gh}.
$$
