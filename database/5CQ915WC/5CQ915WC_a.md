An *elliptic curve* over a field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2, 3$ is a non-singular projective curve $E$ in the projective plane $\mathbb{P}_k^2$ of degree $3$ with a distinguished point $O \in E$, with an abelian group structure such that

- $O$ is the identity;
- if a line $L \in \mathbb{P}_k^2$ intersects $E$ at three points, $P, Q, R$, then $P + Q + R = O$ (under the group law).
