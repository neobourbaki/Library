The *tensor product* of vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over a field $k$ is a $k$-vector space $V \otimes W$, together with a bilinear map $\phi: V \times W \to V\otimes W$, satisfying the universal property: 

- every bilinear map $f: V \times W \to U$ to a $k$-vector space $U$ factors through $\phi$, i.e., there exists a linear map $\tilde{f}: V\otimes W \to U$ such that $f = \tilde{f} \circ \phi$.

The image $\phi(v, w)$ is often denoted $v \otimes w$.
