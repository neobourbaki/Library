The *tensor product* of finite-dimensional vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over a field $k$ is the $k$-vector space (denoted $V \otimes W$) generated by $v_i \otimes w_j$, where $v_i$, $1\leq i \leq n$, form a basis of $V$, and $w_j$, $1 \leq j \leq m$, form a basis of $W$, together with the canonical bilinear map $V \times W \to V \otimes W$ given by $(v_i, w_j) \mapsto v_i\otimes w_j$.
