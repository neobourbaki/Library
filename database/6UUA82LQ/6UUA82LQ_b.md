The *tensor product* of vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over a field $k$ is the $k$-vector space (denoted $V \otimes W$) generated by $v_i \otimes w_j$, where $\\{v_i\\}_{i \in I}$ is a basis of $V$, and $\\{w_j\\}_{j \in J}$ is a basis of $W$, together with the bilinear map $V \times W \to V \otimes W$ given by $(v_i, w_j) \mapsto v_i \otimes w_j$.
