(Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand) Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over the field $\mathbb{C}$. Let $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ be a Cartan subalgebra, $\Phi^+$ a positive system of the root system $\Phi \subset \mathfrak{h}^*$. Then there is a resolution of $V$ by (infinite-dimensional) representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ï¼Œ namely an exact sequence

$$
0 \to \bigoplus_{w \in W, \ell(w)=n} M_{w . \lambda} \to \cdots \to \bigoplus_{w \in W, \ell(w)=1} M_{w . \lambda} \to M_{\lambda} \to V \to 0
$$

where

- $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is the highest weight of $V$ with respect to $\Phi^+$;
- $M_{\lambda}$ is the Verma module associated to $\lambda$;
- $W$ is the Weyl group, acting on $\mathfrak{h}^*$;
- $\ell(w)$ is the minimal length of presentation of $w$ with respect to the simple roots;
- $n = \max \ell(w)$;
- $w . \lambda := w(\lambda + \rho) - \rho$ is the shifted action of $W$ on $\mathfrak{h}^*$;
- $\rho$ is the half of the sum of the positive roots.
