A path in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is *piecewise* $C^1$ if there exists a parametrization $\gamma: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ that is continuous on $[a, b]$, and there exists a partition $(a = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots < a_n = b)$ such that $\gamma$ is continuously differentiable on each $(a_i, a_{i+1})$, with $\gamma'_i: (a_i, a_{i+1}) \to \mathbb{R}^n$ having a continuous extension to $[a_i, a_{i+1}]$.
