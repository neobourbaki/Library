Let $V_i \cong k^n$ be the vector space of the $i$-th column of the $n\times n$ matrices over a field $k$. The determinant is a map $\det: V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n\to k$ such that

- it is multilinear, i.e., it is linear in each factor;
- it is antisymmetric in any two columns $V_i, V_j$;
- $\det(I) = 1$.
