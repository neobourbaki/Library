The determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ over a field or a commutative ring $k$ is given by

$$
\det A = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \mathop{\mathrm{sgn}}(\sigma) A_{1,\sigma(1)} A_{2,\sigma(2)} \cdots A_{n,\sigma(n)}
$$

where $S_n$ is the permutation group on $\\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$, and the sign of a permutation is $\pm 1$ if it is composed of an even or odd number of transpositions.
