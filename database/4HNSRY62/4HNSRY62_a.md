The *determinant* of an $n\times n$ matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ over a commutative ring $k$ is given by

$$
\det A = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \varepsilon(\sigma) a_{1,\sigma(1)} a_{2,\sigma(2)} \cdots a_{n,\sigma(n)}
$$

where $S_n$ is the permutation group on $\\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$, and $\varepsilon(\sigma) = \pm 1$ if $\sigma$ is composed of an even or odd number of transpositions.
