Let $f$ be a function of a single variable, i.e., $f: U \to E$ on an open subset $U \subseteq \mathbf{K}$ of a normed field $\mathbf{K}$, taking values in a vector space $E$ over $K$. The *derivative of* $f$ *at* $x_0 \in U$ is the limit

$$
\lim_{x \in U, x \to x_0} \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} \in E,
$$

and $f$ is said to be *differentiable* (on $U$) if its derivative exists at all $x_0 \in U$, and the *derivative* of $f$ is a function $U \to E$, denoted $f'$.
