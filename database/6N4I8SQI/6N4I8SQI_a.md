The *cosine* of a real number $x \in [0, \pi/2]$ is the distance from the center to the chord of the unit circle, where the chord cuts the circle in two arcs of measure $2x$ and $2\pi - 2x$. For other values of $x \in \mathbb{R}$, the cosine of $x$ is defined by extending using the relations

$$
\cos(-x) = \cos(x)
$$

$$
\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)
$$

for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
