We shall examine the limit of $f(z)$ as $z$ approaches 0 along different directions.

For real values ($z = x$),

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} x^n \sin \frac{1}{x} = 0 \\qquad n > 1
$$

and for imaginary values ($z = iy$),

$$
\lim_{y \to 0} (iy)^n \sin \frac{1}{iy} = \lim_{y \to 0} (iy)^n \frac{e^{1/y} - e^{-1/y}}{2i}
$$

which is $\infty$ up to some constant (of $\pm i$). Therefore the $z=0$ is not a removable singularity of $f(z)$, by a theorem of Riemann.
