The *dimension* of a vector space $V$ over a divion ring $k$, denoted $\dim_{k} V$ or simply $\dim V$, is the minimal number of elements that generate $V$ (over $k$), i.e., the smallest $n$ such that there exist $v_1, \ldots, v_n \in V$ such that any vector $v \in V$ can be written as

$$
v = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i v_i
$$

for some $\alpha_i \in k$. If no finite $n$ exists, $V$ is said to be *infinite-dimensional*, and $\dim V = \infty$ by convention.
