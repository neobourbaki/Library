Let $N$ be a submodule of a module $M$ over a ring $R$. Then the *quotient module* $M/N$ is a $R$-module consisting of the equivalence classes $[m]$ of $m \in M$, under the relation $m \sim m'$ if $m - m' \in N$, on which the addition and multiplication by elements of $R$ are defined by

- $[m] + [m'] = [m + m']$;
- $r[m] = [rm]$.
