A *complex number* $z$ is a pair of real numbers $(x, y)$. The set of complex numbers becomes a field under addition and multiplication defined by

- $(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)$;
- $(x_1, y_1) \cdot (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2 , x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)$

with a norm given by

- $|(x, y)| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

It is customary to write $z = x + iy$, where $i$ is the number $(0, 1)$.
