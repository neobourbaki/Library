The field $\mathbb{C}$ of *complex numbers* is the extension of the field of
real numbers given by $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2+1)$, i.e., a complex number is 
the equivalence class of a polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$, under the 
equivalence relation that $f\sim g$ if $f(x)-g(x)$ is a multiple of $x^2+1$ 
in the ring $\mathbb{R}[x]$.

The equivalence class of the polynomial $x$ is denoted by $i$, and any complex 
number can be written as $x+iy$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{C}$.
