A *complex number* is an element of the ring $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2+1)$, i.e., an equivalence class of $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$, under the equivalence relation that $f\sim g$ if $f(x)-g(x)$ is a multiple of $x^2+1$ in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{R}[x]$.

The equivalence class of the polynomial $x$ is denoted by $i$, and it satisfies $i^2=-1$. Any complex number can be written as $a+ib$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, and the norm is given by $|a + ib| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
