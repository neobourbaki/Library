The *natural numbers* are the equivalence classes of finite sets, under the relation of bijections, i.e., the set of finite cardinalities:

- 0 = (the class of) the empty set;
- 1 = sets containing 1 element (singletons);
- 2 = sets containing 2 elements;
- etc.

Addition is defined by disjoint union (coproduct), and multiplication is defined by (Cartesian) product.
