The set $\mathbb{N}$ of *natural numbers* satisfy the Peano axioms:

- $0$ is a natural number;
- for every natural number $n$, $S(n)$ is a natural number (called the *succesor* of $n$);
- for natural numbers $m$ and $n$, $S(m) = S(n)$ only if $m = n$, i.e., $S$ is injective;
- $0$ is not a succesor of any natural number.

Addition and multiplciation are defined on $\mathbb{N}$ recursively, making $\mathbb{N}$ a monoid.
