The Taylor series of a holomorphic function $f: U \to \mathbb{C}$ at any $z_0 \in U$ converges to $f$ in any disk centered at $z_0$ that is contained in $U$, i.e.,

$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!}(z - z_0)^n
$$

for all $z$ with $$|z - z_0| < R$$, where $R > 0$ satisfies $D(z_0, R) \subseteq U$.
