The *tensor product* of two modules $M, N$ over a commutative ring $R$ is a module $M \otimes N$ (over $R$), together with a bilinear map $\phi: M \times N \to M \otimes N$, such that every bilinear map $f: M \times N \to L$ to an $R$-module factors through $\phi$, i.e., there exists $\tilde{f}: M \otimes N \to L$ such that $f = \tilde{f} \circ \phi$.
