Let $\mathfrak{F}$ be a sheaf of rings on a topological space $X$. Then the stalk of $\mathfak{F}$ at a point $x \in X$ is the direct limit

$$
\lim{U \ni x} \mathfrak{F}(U)
$$

where the direct system is indexed over all open sets containing $x$, with restrictions $\mathfrak{F}(U) \to \mathfrak{F}(V)$ for each inclusion $U \supset V$.
