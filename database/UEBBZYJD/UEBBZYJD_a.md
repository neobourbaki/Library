The group $\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}(n, K)$ consists of matrices with determinant $1$. Thus, an $n\times n$ matrix $X$ is in the Lie algebra of $\mathop{\mathrm{SL}}(n, K)$ if and only if $\det e^X = 1$. By the identity that $\det e^X = e^{\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}(X)}$, it follows that $\mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}(X)=0$.
