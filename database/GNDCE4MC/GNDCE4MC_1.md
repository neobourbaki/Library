(Cauchy's integral formula) Let $f: U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function on a domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, and let $\gamma$ be a closed piecewise $C^1$ path in $U$. For any $z \in U$ such that the winding number of $\gamma$ around $z$ is 1, we have 

$$
f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta - z} d\zeta.
$$
