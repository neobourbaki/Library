A *meromorphic* function on a domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is a function $f: U \setminus Z \to \mathbb{C}$ for a discrete set $Z\subset U$ such that it is locally represented by a Laurent series, i.e. for each $z_0 \in U$, there exist $n_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a_n \in \mathbb C$ for each $n \geq n_0$ such that

$$
f(z) = \sum_{n = n_0}^\infty a_n (z-z_0)^n
$$

for all $z \in U$ with $0 < |z-z_0| < r$, for some $r > 0$.
