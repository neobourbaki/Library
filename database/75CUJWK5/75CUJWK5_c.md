A *meromorphic* function on a domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is a function $f: U \setminus Z \to \mathbb{C}$ for some discrete set $Z \subset U$ that is the quotient of two holomorphic functions on $U$, i.e., there exist holomorphic functions $g, h: U \to \mathbb{C}$ such that 

$$
f(z) = g(z) / h(z)
$$

for all $z \in U \setminus Z$.
