A series $\sum_{n=n_0}^{\infty} x_n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ *converges* if the limit of partial sums

$$
\lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n = n_0}^{N} x_n
$$

exists, and the limit is also called the *sum* of the series; and *diverges* if the limit does not exist. A series in $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{C}^n$ *converges* if the series of each component converges.
