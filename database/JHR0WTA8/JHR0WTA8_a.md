For $n = 0$, it is simply the mean value theorem.

For $n = 1$, one is to prove

$$
f(b) = f(a) + f'(a) (b-a) + \frac{f''(\xi)}{2} (b - a)^2
$$

for some $\xi \in (a, b)$. If we rewrite it as

$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(a) + \frac{f''(\xi)}{2} (b - a)
$$

it is again in the form of the mean value theorem, but for the function $f'$.
