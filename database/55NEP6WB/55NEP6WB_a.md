The *intersection* of two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ is the set $S_1 \cap S_2$ of elements that are members of $S_1$ and members of $S_2$.

For an arbitrary collection of sets $S_i$, the *intersection* of $S_i$, denoted $\cap_i S_i$, is the set of elements that are members of all $S_i$, i.e., elements $x$ such that $x \in S_i$ for all $i$.
