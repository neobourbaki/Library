Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over the field $\mathbb{C}$, and $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ a Cartan subalgebra. Then the characters of representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to $\mathfrak{h}$ satisfy

- $\chi_{V \oplus W} = \chi_V + \chi_W$
- $\chi_{V \otimes W} = \chi_V \cdot \chi_W$

where $V \oplus W$ (and $V \otimes W$, resp.) is the direct sum (tensor product, resp.) of representations $V$ and $W$.

In particular, for $\mathfrak{h}$-finite representations, the equality may be interpreted as equality of (complex) numbers.
