The characters of finite-dimensional representations of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over the field $\mathbb{C}$ with respect to a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ satisfy

- $\chi_{V \oplus W} = \chi_V + \chi_W$
- $\chi_{V \otimes W} = \chi_V \chi_W$

where $V \oplus W$ (and $V \otimes W$, resp.) is the direct sum (tensor product, resp.) of representations $V$ and $W$, and on the right is addition (and multiplication, resp.) in the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{h}]$.
