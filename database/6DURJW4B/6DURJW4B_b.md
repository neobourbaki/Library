The (real) *projective plane* consists of

- the set of lines through a fixed point $O$ in the Euclidean 3-space, called the *points*;
- the set of (2-dimensional) planes through $O$, called the *lines*,

with the *incidence relation* of the points and the lines defined by the incidence relation in the 3-space.
