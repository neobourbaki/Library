The (real) *projective plane* is the extension of the Euclidean plane (the points and lines of Euclidean geometry, referred to as the *ordinary* points and lines) by a set of *points at infinity*, one for each equivalence class of parallel lines in the Euclidean plane, and a single *line at infinity*, with the following *incidence relation*: a point $p$ is *incident* on a line $L$ if one of the following is true

- $p$ is an ordinary point, and $L$ is an ordinary line, and $p$ is incident on $L$;
- $p$ is a point at infinity, and $L$ is a line in the equivalence class for $p$;
- $p$ is a point at infinity, and $L$ is the line at infinity.

One may regard the line as the set of all points incident on it, and use the set notation $p \in L$ to denote incidence.
