The (real) *projective plane* $\mathbb{P}^2 = \mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{R}}^2$ consists of

- the set of 1-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$, called the *points*
- the set of 2-dimenisional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$, called the *lines*

with the *incidence relation* on the points and the lines defined by containment of subspaces. We may regard a line as the set of points incident on it, and use the set notation $p \in L$.
