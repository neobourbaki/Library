The (real) *projective plane* is the quotient space of the manifold $\mathbb{R}^3 - \\{0\\}$ by the action of a group

$$
\mathbb{P}^3 = (\mathbb{R}^3 - \\{0\\}) / \mathbb{R}^*.
$$

A *line* in $\mathbb{P}^3$ is the image of $\pi - \\{0\\}$, where $\pi$ is a plane (2-dimensional subspace) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ through the origin.
