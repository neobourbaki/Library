A (topological) *manifold* of dimension $n$, or a $n$-*manifold*, is a subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that for each $x \in X$, there exists an open set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ containing $x$, an open subset $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and a continuous injection $\phi: V \to \mathbb{R}^N$ such that $U \cap X$ is the image of $V$ under $\phi$, and $\phi^{-1}: U \cap X \to V$ is continuous, hence a homeomorphism.
