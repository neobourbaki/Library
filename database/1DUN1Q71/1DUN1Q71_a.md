A function $f: U \to \mathbb{C}$ on a domina $U \subseteq \mathbb C$ 
is *holomorphic* if it is *differentiable* at every $z_0 \in U$, i.e.,
the limit 

$$
\lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}
$$

exists for each fixed $z_0$. The *derivative* of $f$ is a function, 
denoted $f': U \to \mathbb{C}$, whose value $f'(z_0)$ at $z_0 \in U$ 
is given by that limit.
