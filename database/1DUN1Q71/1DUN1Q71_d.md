A function $f: U \to \mathbb{C}$ on a domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is *holomorphic* (or *analytic*) if its real part $u: U \to \mathbb{R}$ is harmonic, i.e., 

$$
\Delta u := \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
$$

on $U$, and its imaginary part $v$ is the harmonic conjugate of $u$, i.e., it satisfies

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
$$

on $U$.
