A *basis* of a vector space $V$ over a field $k$ is a subset $S \subset V$ such that every vector $v \in V$ can be written in a unique way as finite linear combination of members of $S$, i.e.,

$$
v = \sum_{v_i \in S} \alpha_i v_i 
$$

where $\alpha_i \in k$, all but finitely many of which are zero.
