Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a piecewise continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$, taking values in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the *integral* of $f$ is an element in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the $i$-th component given by the integral of the $i$-th component of $f$.
