Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ be a piecewise continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$, i.e., there exist a finite number of points $a = a_0 < a_1 < \cdots a_n = b$ such that $f$ is continuous on each $(a_i, a_{i+1})$, and can be continued continuously to a $f_i: [a_i, a_{i+1}] \to \mathbb{C}$. Then the integral of $f$ is

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\, dx = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \int_{a_i}^{a_{i+1}} f_i(x) \\, dx.
$$
