Applying the sum-of-angles formula,

$$
\sin(x+dx) = \sin(x) \cos(dx) + \cos(x) \sin(dx)
$$

and with $\sin(dx) = dx$ up to first order, and $\cos(dx) = 1$, we have

$$
\sin(x+dx) = \sin(x) + \cos(x) dx
$$

yielding that $d\sin(x) = \cos(x) dx$.

Similarly, we have

$$
\cos(x+dx) = \cos(x)\cos(dx) - \sin(x)\sin(dx) = \cos(x) - \sin(x) dx
$$

or $d\cos(x) = - \sin(x) dx$.
