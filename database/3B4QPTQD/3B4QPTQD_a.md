A subset $S = \\{ v_i \\}_{i \in I}$ of a vector space $V$ over a division ring $k$ is *linearly independent* if a finite sum

$$
\sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i v_i = 0 \\;, \qquad \alpha_i \in k
$$

(all but finitely many of $\alpha_i$ are 0) only when all the $\alpha_i = 0$. By abuse of language, one also says that the members of $S$ are *linearly independent*.
