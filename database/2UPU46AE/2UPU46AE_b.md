The (left) *action* of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a group homomorphism $\phi: G \to \Sym(X)$, where $\Sym(X)$ is the group of all bijective maps $X \to X$, under composition. The map $(g, x) \mapsto \phi(g)x$ is also simply denoted $gx$.

A set $X$, along with an action of $G$ on it, is called a $G$-*set*.
