The (left) *action* of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a group homomorphism $\phi: G \to \mathrm{Sym}(X)$, where $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ is the group of all bijective maps $X \to X$, under composition. Given $g \in G$ and $x \in X$, the element $\phi(g)(x) \in X$ is also denoted $g \cdot x$ or simply $gx$.

A set $X$, along with an action of $G$ on it, is called a $G$-*set*.
