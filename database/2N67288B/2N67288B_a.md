Let $f: U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function on a domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, and let $\gamma$ be a piecewise $C^1$ path in $U$, i.e., there exists a parametrization $\gamma: [a, b] \to U$, continuous on $[a, b]$ and continuously differentiable on $(a, b)$ except a finite number of points. Then the *integral* of $f(z)$ along $\gamma$ is 

$$
\int_{\gamma} f(z) \\, dz := \int_{a}^{b} f(\gamma(t)) \gamma'(t)\\, dt.
$$
