Let $f: U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a continuous function on a domain $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, and let $\gamma$ be a piecewise $C^1$ path in $U$, consisting of $\gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_n$. Then the *integral* of $f(z)$ along $\gamma$ is the sum of

$$
\int_{\gamma_i} f(z) \\, dz := \int_{0}^{1} f(\gamma_i(t)) \gamma'(t)\\, dt
$$

where we have chosen a parametrization $\gamma_i : [0, 1] \to U$, continuous on $[0, 1]$ and continuously differentiable on $(0, 1)$.
