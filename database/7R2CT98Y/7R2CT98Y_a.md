A *ring* is an abelian group $(R, +)$, together with a binary operation $R \times R \to R$, $(r, s) \mapsto rs$ (called *multiplication*) satisfying

- $(rs)t = r(st)$
- $(r+s)t = rt+st$ 
- $t(r+s) = tr+ts$

for all $r, s, t \in R$, and that

- there exists a multiplicative identity, i.e., $1 \in R$ such that $1r = r1 = r$ for all $r \in R$.
