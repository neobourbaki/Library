Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ a Cartan subalgebra, and $\mathfrak{b}$ a Borel subalgebra containing $\mathfrak{h}$. The *Verma module* associated to a weight $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is a representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ of highest weight $\lambda$ defined by extension of scalar

$$
M_{\lambda} = U(\mathfrak{g}) \otimes_{U(\mathfrak{b})} \mathbb{C}_{\lambda}
$$

where $\mathbb{C}_{\lambda}$ is the 1-dimensional representation of $\mathfrak{b} = \mathbb{h} \oplus \mathbb{n}$ for which $\mathfrak{h}$ acts as multiplication by $\lambda$ (i.e., $Xv = \langle \lambda, X \rangle v$ for $X \in \mathfrak{h}$ and $v \in \mathbb{C}_{\lambda}$) and $\mathfrak{n}$ acts trivially.
