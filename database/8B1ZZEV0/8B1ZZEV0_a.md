Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over the field $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ a Cartan subalgebra, and $\mathfrak{b} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \mathfrak{n}^*$ the Borel sulabgebra, with a choice of positive system $\Phi^+$ of the root system $\Phi \subset \mathfrak{h}^*$. The *Verma module* associative to a weight $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ is a representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ of highest weight $\lambda$ defined by extension of scalar

$$
M_{\lambda} = U(\mathfrak{g}) \otimes_{U(\mathfrak{b})} \mathbb{C}_{\lambda}
$$

where $\mathbb{C}_{\lambda}$ is the 1-dimensional representation of $\mathfrak{b}$ for which $\mathfrak{h}$ acts as multiplication by $\lambda$ (i.e., $Xv = \langle \lambda, X \rangle v$ for $X \in \mathfrak{h}$ and $v \in \mathbb{C}_{\lambda}$) and $\mathfrak{n}^+$ acts trivially.
