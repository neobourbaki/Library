A *real number* is an integer $a_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$, together with a sequence of digits $a_1, a_2, \ldots \in \\{0, 1, \ldots, 9\\}$ which does not end in an infinite string of $9$'s (that is, there does not exist $N$ such that $a_n = 9$ for all $n > N$).

The *field* $\mathbb{R}$ *of real numbers* is the set of all real numbers, together with the natural operations of addition and multiplication, and the order relation, with the only caveat that an infinite string of $9$'s should be identified with the "immediate next" decimal ending in $0$'s.
