A *real number* is a nonempty proper subset $A\subset \mathbb Q$ of rational
numbers, such that
- if $a\in A$, $b\in \mathbb Q$ with $b > a$, then $b \in A$;
- $A$ does not have a least element.

The partition of $\mathbb Q$ as the disjoint union of $A$ and $A^c$, with or without the
second condition, is often called a *Dedekind cut*, and $A$ (and $A^c$, resp.) may be called
the *upper set* (*lower set*, resp.) of the real number that it defines. 
On the set of all real numbers, the operations of addition and multiplication, 
and an order relation, are defined as follows:

- (order): If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are real numbers defined by upper sets
$A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively, then $x_1$ is *greater than or equal to* $x_2$
(denoted $x_1 \geq x_2$) if $A_1 \subseteq A_2$.

- (addition): The *sum* of two real numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ defined by
$A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively, is the number defined by

$$
A_1 + A_2 := \\{a_1 + a_2 \\,|\\, a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2 \\}.
$$

- (multiplication, positive): If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are positive, their *product* is
defined by

$$
A_1 \cdot A_2 := \\{a_1 \cdot a_2 \\,|\\, a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2 \\}.
$$

- (negation): The negative of a real number $x$ defined by $A$ is the real number
defined by $-A^c$ if $A^c$ does not have a greatest element; and if $A^c$ does
have a greatest element, $a$, then the negative of $x$ is defined by $-(A^c-\\{a\\})$.

- (multiplication, general) If $x_1$ or $x_2$ is negative, then we first negate it, then
multiply the two upper sets as before, and then negate the resulting set if only one of
$x_1$ and $x_2$ is negative.

Thus the set of real numbers is made into an ordered field, denoted by $\mathbb{R}$, 
that is compatible with the structure of the order field $\mathbb Q$ of rational numbers.
