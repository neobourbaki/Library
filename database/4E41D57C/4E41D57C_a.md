A *Dedekind cut* is a partition of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q} = A \cup B$ 
such that $A$ and $B$ are nonempty and disjoint, and every element of $A$ is 
less than or equal to any element of $B$, and that $A$ does not have a largest 
element. A *real number* is a Dedekind cut, with the operations and order 
defined by the following:

- (Order): If $x$ and $y$ are real numbers defined by Dedekind cuts
$(A_x, B_x)$ and $(A_y, B_y)$ respectively, then $x \leq y$ if and only
if $A_x \subseteq A_y$.
- (Addition): The sum of two real numbers $x$ and $y$, represented by
$(A_x, B_x)$ and $(A_y, B_y)$, is the Dedekind cut $(A_x + A_y, B_x + B_y)$ 
where $A_x + A_y = \\{a + b \\,|\\, a \in A_x, b \in A_y\\}$.
- (Multiplication): If $x$ and $y$ are positive, their product is defined 
by $(A_x \cdot A_y, B_x \cdot B_y)$ where 
$A_x \cdot A_y = \\{a \cdot b \\,|\\, a \in A_x, b \in A_y, a, b > 0\\}$.
For general real numbers, multiplication takes into account the signs of
the numbers, following the rule that the product of two numbers with the same
sign is positive and with opposite signs is negative.

These operations make the set of real numbers into a field, denoted by
$\mathbb{R}$.
