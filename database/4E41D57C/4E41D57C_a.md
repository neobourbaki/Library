A *Dedekind cut* is a partition of the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q} = A \cup B$ 
such that $A$ and $B$ are nonempty and disjoint, and every element of $A$ is 
less than or equal to any element of $B$, and that $A$ does not have a largest 
element. A *real number* is a Dedekind cut, with the operations and order 
defined by the following:

- (order): If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are real numbers defined by Dedekind cuts
$(A_1, B_1)$ and $(A_2, B_2)$ respectively, then $x \leq y$ if
 $A_1 \subseteq A_2$.
- (addition): The sum of two real numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$, defined by
$(A_1, B_1)$ and $(A_2, B_2)$, is the Dedekind cut $(A_1 + A_2, B_1 + B_2)$ 
where the sum of two sets is defined by

$$
A + B := \\{a + b \\,|\\, a \in A, b \in B \\}.
$$

- (multiplication, positive): If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are positive, their product is defined 
by $(A_x \cdot A_y, B_x \cdot B_y)$ where 
$A_x \cdot A_y = \\{a \cdot b \\,|\\, a \in A_x, b \in A_y, a, b > 0\\}$.

- (negation): The negative of $(A, B)$ is defined as $(-B, -A)$ if $B$ does not have a
least element; and if $B$ does, then that element $(b)$ is removed and added to the set
$A$ before negation.

- (multiplication, general) For general real numbers, multiplication is defined by way of
the positive parts, with the sign convention that of the rational numbers.

Thus the set of real numbers is made into a field, denoted by $\mathbb{R}$, and the order 
satisfy the same rules as the rational numbers.
