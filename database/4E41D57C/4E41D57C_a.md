A *real number* is a nonempty proper subset $A\subset \mathbb Q$ of rational
numbers, such that
- every element of $A$ is (strictly) greater than any element of the complement
$A^c:= \mathbb Q \setminus A$;
- $A$ does not have a least element.

The partition of $\mathbb Q$ as the disjoint union of $A$ and $B$ is often called
a *Dedekind cut*, and $A$ may be called the *upper set* of the real number $x$. 
On the set of all real numbers, the operations of addition and multiplication, 
and an order relation, are defined as follows:

- (order): If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are real numbers defined by upper sets
$A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively, then $x_1$ is *greater than or equal to* $x_2$
(denoted $x_1 \geq x_2$) if $A_1 \subseteq A_2$.

- (addition): The *sum* of two real numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ defined by
$A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively, is the number defined by

$$
A_1 + A_2 := \\{a_1 + a_2 \\,|\\, a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2 \\}.
$$

- (multiplication, positive): If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are positive, their *product* is
defined by

$$
A_1 \cdot A_2 = \\{a_1 \cdot a_2 \\,|\\, a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2 \\}.
$$

- (negation): The negative of $A$ is defined as $-A^c$ if $A^c$ does not have a
greatest element; and if $A^c$ does have a greatest element, $x$, then the negative
of $A$ is defined by $-(A^c-\{x\})$.

- (multiplication, general) For general real numbers, multiplication is defined by way of
the positive parts, with the sign convention that of the rational numbers.

Thus the set of real numbers is made into a field, denoted by $\mathbb{R}$, and the order 
satisfy the same rules as the rational numbers.
