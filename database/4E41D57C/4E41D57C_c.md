A *real number* is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, under the equivalence relation that $\\{a_n\\} \sim \\{b_n\\}$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that

$$
| a_n - b_n | < \epsilon
$$

for all $n > N$.

The *field of real numbers* is the set of all real numbers, together with the natural operations of addition and multiplication, as well as the order relation, defined as follows:

- $\\{a_n\\} + \\{b_n\\} = \\{a_n + b_n\\}$
- $\\{a_n\\} \cdot \\{b_n\\} = \\{a_n \cdot b_n\\}$
- $\\{a_n\\} < \\{b_n\\}$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that $b_n - a_n > \epsilon$ for all $n > N$.
