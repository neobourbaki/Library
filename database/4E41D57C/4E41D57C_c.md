A *real number* is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational
numbers, under the equivalence relation that $\\{a_n\\} \sim \\{b_n\\}$ if 
and only if for every $\epsilon$, there exists $N$ such that

$$
| a_n - b_m | < \epsilon
$$

for all $n, m > N$.

On the set of all real numbers, the operations of addition and multiplication, 
and the order relation, are defined as follows:

- $\\{a_n\} + \\{b_n\} = \\{a_n + b_n\\}$
- $\\{a_n\\} \cdot \\{b_n\\} = \\{a_n \cdot b_n\\}$
- $\\{a_n\\} < \\{b_n\\}$ if for every $\epsilon$, there exists $N$ such
 that $b_n - a_n > \epsilon$ for all $n > N$.

These definitions are independent of the choice of representative.
