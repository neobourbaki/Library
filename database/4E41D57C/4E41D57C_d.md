The *field* $\mathbb{R}$ *of real numbers* is an ordered field that satisfies the following properties:

- there is a homomorphism $\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$ of ordered fields; 
- (Archimedean property): For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x < N$;
- (Completeness, or Least Upper Bound property): Any nonempty subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded from above has a least upper bound.
