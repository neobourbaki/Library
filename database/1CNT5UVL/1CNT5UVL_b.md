The *integral* of a continuous function $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ on a closed interval $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ is the supremum of the integrals of simple functions on $[a, b]$ that are bounded by $f$ from above.

If the function $f$ is piecewise continuous, then the *integral* of $f$ is the sum of the integrals over the pieces.
