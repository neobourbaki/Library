Let $R$ be a subring of a ring $S$, and $M$ a module over $R$. Then the *extension* of $M$ by scalars is the tensor product $S \otimes_{R} M$, where $S$ is regarded as a right module over $R$, with the (left) $S$-module structure given by

$$
s(s' \otimes m) = (ss') \otimes m
$$

for $s, s' \in S$ and $m \in M$.
