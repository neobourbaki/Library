(Spectral theorem) Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ Hermitian matrix. Then all the eigenvalues of $A$ are real, and there exist $n$ orthonormal eigenvectors $v_i \in \mathbb{C}^n$, i.e.,

$$
A v_i = \lambda_i v_i \\;, \qquad i=1,\ldots,n
$$

with $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$. In other words, $A$ is diagonalizable by a unitary matrix: $A = UDU^{-1}$ where $D=\text{Diag}(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)$, and $U$ is composed of $v_i$'s as the columns.
