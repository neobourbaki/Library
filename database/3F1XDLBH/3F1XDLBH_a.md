A *homotopy* of two paths $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ in a topological space $S$ is a continuous map $H: [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \to S$ such that $H(t, 0)$ is a parametrization for $\gamma_1$ and $H(t, 1)$ is a parametrization for $\gamma_2$. If a homotopy exists between two paths, we say $\gamma_1$ is *homotopic to* $\gamma_2$.
