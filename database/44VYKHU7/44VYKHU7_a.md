The *category* $\mathcal{Mod}_{R}$ *of modules over a* (commutative) *ring* $R$ is a category with morphisms $R \to M$ in $\mathcal{Ab}$ as the objects, and morphisms $M \to N$ in $\mathcal{Ab}$ that commute with $R \to M$ and $R \to N$ as the morphisms. One refers to $M$ as the object of $\mathcal{Mod}_{R}$, when the morphism $R \to M$ is understood from context.
