Let $\mathcal{Ab}$ be the category of abelian groups, and $R$ be a commutative ring (thus is an object of $\mathcal{Ab}$). The *category* $\mathcal{Mod}_{R}$ of $R$-modules is a category with morphisms $R \to M$ in $\mathcal{Ab}$ as the objects, and morphisms $M \to N$ in $\mathcal{Ab}$ that commute with $R \to M$ and $R \to N$ as the morphisms. One may refer to $M$ as the object of $\mathcal{Mod}_{R}$ when the morphism $R \to M$ is understood from context.
