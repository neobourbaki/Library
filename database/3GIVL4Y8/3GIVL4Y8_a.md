The *polynomial ring* over a (commutative) ring $R$ is the commutative ring $R[x]$ of all polynomials

$$
p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
$$

of degree $\leq n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, with coefficients $a_i \in R$. The operations of addition and multiplication are defined on the monomials, e.g., $x^n \cdot x^m = x^{n+m}$.
