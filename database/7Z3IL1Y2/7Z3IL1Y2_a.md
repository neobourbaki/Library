The *universal enveloping algebra* of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over a field $k$ is an associative algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ over $k$, together with a homomorphism of Lie algebras $\phi: \mathfrak{g} \to U(\mathfrak{g})_L$, satisfying the universal property:

- for any associative algebra $U$ over $k$, and any homomorphism of Lie algebras $f: \mathfrak{g} \to U_L$, there exists a homomorphism of associative algebras $\tilde{f}: U(\mathfrak{g}) \to U$ such that $f = \tilde{f} \circ \phi$.
