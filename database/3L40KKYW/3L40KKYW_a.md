A *Lie group* over $\mathbf{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ is a smooth manifold $G$ (over $\mathbf{K}$) with a group structure, i.e., a binary operation $G \times G \to G$, $(g, h) \mapsto gh$ with an identity element $e \in G$, and each $g \in G$ has an inverse $g^{-1}$, such that the maps $(g, h) \mapsto gh$ and $g \mapsto g^{-1}$ are smooth.
