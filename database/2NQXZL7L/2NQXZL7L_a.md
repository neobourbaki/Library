The *linear span* of a set of vectors $v_i$, $i \in I$, in a vector space $V$ over a division ring $k$ is the set of (finite) *linear combinations*

$$
\sum_{i \in I} a_i v_i
$$

for $a_i \in k$, all but finitely many of which are zero. It is a $k$-vector space under the addition and the scalar multiplication on $V$.
