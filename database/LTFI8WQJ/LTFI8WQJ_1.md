(Theorem of the highest weight) Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over the field $\mathbb{C}$, and $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ a Cartan subalgebra, $\Phi \subset \mathfrak{h}^*$ the root system with positive system $\Phi^+$. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ and dominant integral weights $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ with respect to $\Phi^+$.
