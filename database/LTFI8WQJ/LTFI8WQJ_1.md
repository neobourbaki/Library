(Highest weight theorem) Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over the field $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ a Cartan subalgebra, and $\Phi^+$ a choice of positive system of the root system $\Phi \subset \mathfrak{h}^*$. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and dominant integral weights $\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ with respect to $\Phi^+$.
