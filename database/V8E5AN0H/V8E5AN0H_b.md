One can construct a sequence $p_i$ of primes as follows:

- Let $p_0 = 2$ be the first prime;
- To define $p_n$, let $N = p_0 p_1 \cdots p_{n-1} + 1$, and if $N$ is a prime, then set $p_{n} = N$; otherwise, let $p_{n}$ be the smallest prime divisor of $N$.

As this process never ends, there are infinitely many primes.
