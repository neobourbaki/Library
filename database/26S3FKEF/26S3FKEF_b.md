A *polynomial* over a (commutative) ring $R$ of degree $n$ is a formal expression

$$
p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0
$$

with $a_i \in R$, $a_n \neq 0$, and $n$ is called the *degree* of $p(x)$. In other words, it is identified with an $n$-tuple $[a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_1, a_0] \in R^{n+1}$ with $a_n \neq 0$.
