Let $(V, \pi)$ be a representation of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $\mathfrak{h}$ be a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $G$ be a simply-connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $\Pi: G \to GL(V)$ be the corresponding representation, i.e., $\pi = d \Pi$. Then the *character* $\chi_V: \mathfrak{h} \to \mathbb{C}$ of the representation is given by the character of the group representation, namely,

$$
\chi_V(X) = \mathrm{Tr}(\tilde{\pi} (e^X)) \\; , \qquad X \in \mathfrak{h}.
$$
