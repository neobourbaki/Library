A *metric space* is a set $M$, together with a distance function $d: M \times M \to k$ taking values in a (totally) ordered field $k$, satisfying that

- (positivity) $d(x, y) \geq 0$, with equality only when $x = y$;
- (symmetry) $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$;
- (triangle inequality) $d(x, y) + d(y, z) \geq d(x, z)$

for all $x, y, z \in M$.
