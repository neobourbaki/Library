A function $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ on an interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ 
is *differentiable* at $x_0 \in I$ if the limit

$$
\lim_{x\to x_0} \frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}
$$

exists, and its value is called the *derivative of $f$ at* $x_0$. If $f$ 
is differentiable at all $x_0 \in I$, we say $f$ is differentiable (on $I$), 
and the derivative, denoted $f'$, is a function from $I$ to $\mathbb R$.
