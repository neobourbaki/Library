A function $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ on an interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is *differentiable at* $x_0 \in I$ if there exists a function 
$L:I\to\mathbb R$, continuous at $x_0$, such that

$$
f(x) = f(x_0) + L(x) (x-x_0).
$$

The value $L(x_0)$ is called the *derivative of* $f$ *at* $x_0$. We say that $f$ is *differentiable* (on $I$) if $f$ is differentiable at all $x_0\in I$, and the *derivative*, denoted $f'$, is again a function from $I$ to $\mathbb R$.
