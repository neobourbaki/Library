A *vector field* $X$ on a smooth $n$-manifold $M$ is locally given by an expression

$$
X = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i (x) \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}
$$

on each local coordinate chart $(U_{\alpha}, x_i)$, such that for any pair of charts $(U_{\alpha}, x_i)$ and $(U_{\beta}, y_j)$, the functions $\alpha_i$'s and $\beta_j$'s are related by

$$
\alpha_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \beta_j \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial y_j}
$$

on the overlap $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$ (as suggested by the notation).
