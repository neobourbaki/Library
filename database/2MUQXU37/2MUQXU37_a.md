A *vector field* $X$ on a smooth $n$-manifold $M$ is locally given by an expression

$$
X = \sum_{i=1}^n f^{\alpha}_i (x) \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}
$$

on each local coordinate chart $(U_{\alpha}, x_i)$, such that for any pair of $(U_{\alpha}, x_i)$ and $(U_{\beta}, y_j)$, the functions $f^{\alpha}_i$ and $g^{\beta}_j$ are related by

$$
f^{\alpha}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} g^{\beta}_j \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial y_j}
$$

as suggested by the notation.
