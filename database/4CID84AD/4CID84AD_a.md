A *map* of sets $X$ and $Y$ is a subset $G \subseteq X \times Y$ such that for every $x \in X$, there exists a unique $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in G$. It is denoted $f: X \to Y$, and the unique element $y$ for a given $x \in X$ is called the *value* of $f$ at $x$, denoted $f(x)$ or sometimes $x.f$; the set $G = \\{(x, f(x)) \\; : \\; x \in X \\}$ is called the *graph* of $f$.
