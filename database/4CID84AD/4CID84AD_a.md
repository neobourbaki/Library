A *map* $f: X \to Y$ of sets $X$ and $Y$ is a subset $G_f \subseteq X \times Y$ such that for every $x \in X$, there exists a unique $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in G_f$. The set $G_f$ is known as the *graph* of $f$, and the element $y$ is called the *value* of $f$ at $x$, denoted $f(x)$ or sometimes $s.f$.
