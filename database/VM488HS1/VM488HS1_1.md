Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a field $k$ (of characteristic $\neq 2, 3$), with a distinguished point $O \in E$. Then the binary operation $E \times E \to E$, $(P, Q) \mapsto P+Q$, as defined below is associative.

- For distinct points $P, Q \in E$, take a line $L_1$ connecting $P$ and $Q$, and it intersects $E$ at a third point $R$.
- Take a line $L_2$ connecting $O$ and $R$, and it intersects $E$ at a third point, which is defined to be $P+Q$.
- If $P$ and $Q$ coincide, or $O$ and $E$ coincide, the line is understood to be the tangent line to $E$ at that point.
