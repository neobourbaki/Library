Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, and $(V, \pi)$ a representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbb{C}$. A *weight* of the representation with respect to a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ is an element $\mu \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ such that

$$
V_{\mu} := \\{ v \in V \\; : \\; \pi(X) v = \mu(X) v \\; \text{for all} \\; X \in \mathfrak{h} \\}
$$

is nonzero. The vector space $V_{\mu}$ is called the *weight space*, and a nonzero vector in $V_{\mu}$ a *weight vector*, for the weight $\mu$. The *multiplicity* of $\mu$, denoted $m_{\mu}$, is the dimension of the weight space:

$$
m_{\mu} := \dim V_{\mu}.
