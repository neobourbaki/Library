Let $(V, \pi)$ be a representation of a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over the field $\mathbb{C}$, and let $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ be a Cartan subalgebra. A *weight* of the representation is an element $\mu \in \mathfrak{h}^*$ such that

$$
V_{\mu} = \\{ v \in V \\; : \\; \pi(X) v = \mu(X) v \\; \text{for all} \\; X \in \mathfrak{h} \\}
$$

is nonzero. A nonzero vector in $V_{\mu}$ is called a *weight vector*, and $V_{\mu}$ is the *weight space*, for weight $\mu \in \mathfrak{h}^*$.
