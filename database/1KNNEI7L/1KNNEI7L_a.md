A *topology* on a set $S$ is a set $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $S$ satisfying

- the empty set $\emptyset$ and $S$ are in $\mathcal{T}$;
- any union of members in $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$;
- any finite intersection of members in $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

A set $S$ with a topoplogy $\mathcal{T}$ on $S$ is known as a *topological space*. A subset of $S$ is *open* if it is in $\mathcal{T}$, and *closed* if its complement is in $\mathcal{T}$.
