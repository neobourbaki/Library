A *topology* on a set $X$ is a set $\mathcal{O}$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying

- the empty set $\emptyset$ and $X$ are members of $\mathcal{O}$;
- any union of members of $\mathcal{O}$ is a member of $\mathcal{O}$;
- any finite intersection of members of $\mathcal{O}$ is a member of $\mathcal{O}$.

A set $X$ with a topology $\mathcal{O}$ on $X$ is known as a *topological space*. A subset of $X$ is *open* if it is a member of $\mathcal{O}$, and *closed* if its complement is a member of $\mathcal{O}$.
