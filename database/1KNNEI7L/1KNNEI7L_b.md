A *topology* on a set $X$ is a set $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying

- the empty set $\emptyset$ and $X$ are members of $\mathcal{C}$;
- any finite union of members of $\mathcal{C}$ is a member of $\mathcal{C}$;
- any intersection of members of $\mathcal{C}$ is a member of $\mathcal{C}$.

A set $X$ with a topology $\mathcal{C}$ on $S$ is known as a *topological space*. A subset of $X$ is *closed* if it is a member of $\mathcal{C}$, and *open* if its complement is a member of $\mathcal{C}$.
