The *exponential* of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ over a field $k$ is given by the power series

$$
e^A = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{m!} A^m,
$$

i.e., the $n\times n$ matrix $e^A$ is defined (over $k$) only when the series of the $(i,j)$-th entries on the right converges in $k$, for each $1 \leq i, j \leq n$.
