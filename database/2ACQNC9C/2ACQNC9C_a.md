A *projective* $n$-*space* consists of

- a set of *points*,
- a set of *lines*,
- a set of 2-*planes*,
- ...
- a set of $(n-1)$-*planes*

and *incidence relations* among them, such that

- for any two distinct points, there is a unique line incident on both;
- for any three distinct points that are not *colinear*, there is unique 2-plane incident on all three;
- ...
