A map $f: X \to Y$ of metric spaces is *continuous at* $x_0 \in X$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exist $\delta$ such that 

$$
| f(x) - f(x_0) | < \epsilon
$$

for all $x \in M$ such that $|x - x_0| < \delta$, $x \neq x_0$. One says that $f$ is *continuous* if it is continuous at all $x \in X$.
