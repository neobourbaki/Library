A *semiring* is a set $R$, together with two binary operations, $+$ and $\cdot$, on $R$, satisfying

- $(R, +)$ is a commutative monoid;
- $(R, \cdot)$ is a monoid;
- $\cdot$ distributes over $+$, i.e., $(a+b) \cdot c$ = $a \cdot c + b \cdot c$ and $a \cdot (b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$, for all $a, b, c \in R$.

The additive identity is often denoted $0$, and the multiplicative identity is denoted $1$.
