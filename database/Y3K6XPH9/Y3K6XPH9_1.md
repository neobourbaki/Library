(Poincar√© duality) Let $M$ be a compact connected orientable manifold of dimension $n$. Then there is an isomorphism of the $k$-th cohomology group with the $(n-k)$-th homology group with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$,

$$
H^{k}(M, \mathbb{Z}) \cong H_{n-k}(M, \mathbb{Z})
$$

for each $0 \leq k \leq n$.
