The *characteristic* of a field $k$ is the smallest number $p > 0$ such that $p \cdot 1 := 1 + 1 + \cdots 1$ ($p$ times) is equal to $0$ (in $k$), and it is denoted $\mathop{\mathrm{char}} k = p$. If no such $p$ exists, $k$ is said to be of *characteristic zero*, and  $\mathop{\mathrm{char}} k = 0$.
