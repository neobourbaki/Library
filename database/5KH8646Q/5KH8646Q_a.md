An *equivalence relation* on a set $S$ is a relation $\sim$ satisfying

- (reflexivity) $a \sim a$
- (symmetry) if $a \sim b$, then $b \sim a$
- (transitivity) if $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$, then $a \sim c$

for $a, b, c \in S$. One says that $a$ and $b$ are *equivalent* if $a \sim b$. The *equivalence class* of an element $a \in S$ is the set of all elements that are equivalent to $a$.
