Any nonempty subset $S \subset\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded from above (i.e., there exists $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $s \leq M$ for all $s \in S$) has a least upper bound (supremum), i.e., there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that 

- $s \leq x$ for all $s \in S$;
- if $s \leq y$ for all $s \in S$, then $x \leq y$.
