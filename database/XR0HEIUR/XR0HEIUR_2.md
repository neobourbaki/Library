Any nonempty subset $S \subset\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded from below (i.e., there exists $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $s \geq M$ for all $s \in S$) has a greatest lower bound, i.e., there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that 

- $s \geq x$ for all $s \in S$;
- if $s \geq y$ for all $s \in S$, then $x \geq y$.
