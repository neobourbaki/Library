(Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) Let $p(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ be a polynomial with complex coefficients of degree $n \geq 1$. Then there exists exactly $n$ roots, counted with multiplicity, i.e., there exists $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in \mathbb{C}$ such that

$$
p(x) = a_n (x - \alpha_1) \cdots (x - \alpha_n).
$$
