A *group* is a set $G$, together with a binary operation $G\times G\to G$, $(g, h)\mapsto gh$ (called the *group law* or *multiplication*) such that

- (associativity) $g(hk) = (gh)k$ for all $g,h,k\in G$;
- there exists an *identity* $e\in G$, i.e., $ge=eg=g$ for all $g\in G$;
- for any $g \in G$, there exists an $h\in G$ such that $gh=hg=e$ ($h$ is known as the *inverse* to $g$, and is denoted $g^{-1}$).
