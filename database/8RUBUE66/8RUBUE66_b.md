Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ be a smooth $n$-manifold, and $\phi: V \to \mathbb{R}^N$ be a parametrization of a neighborhood of a point $x \in X$. Then the *tangent space* of $X$ at $x$ is the (affine) $n$-space based at $x$ that is spanned by the vectors

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} \\; , \\; i=1, \ldots, n.
$$

where $x_i$ is the $i$-th coordinate of $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$.
