Let $M \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ be a smooth $n$-manifold, and $\phi: V \to \mathbb{R}^N$ be a parametrization of a neighborhood of a point $p \in M$, with $V$ an open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\phi(0)=p$. Then the *tangent space* of $M$ at $p$ is the (affine) $n$-space based at $p$ that is spanned by the vectors

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i} (0) \in \mathbb{R}^N \\; , \\; i=1, \ldots, n.
$$

where $x_i$ is the $i$-th coordinate of $V$. The tangent space is independent of the parametrization $\phi$.
