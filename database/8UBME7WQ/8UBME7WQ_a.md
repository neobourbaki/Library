A (left) *module* over a ring $R$ is an abelian group $M$, together with a map $R \times M \to M$, $(r, m) \mapsto rm$ satisfying

- $r(m+n) = rm + rn$
- $(r+s) m = rm + sm$
- $(rs)m = r(sm)$
- $1m = m$

for all $r, s \in R$, $m, n \in M$. One may say that $R$ *acts* on $M$ (from the left) for the map $r \mapsto (m \mapsto rm)$.
