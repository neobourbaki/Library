A *field* $k$ is a set with two binary operations, addition $+$ and multiplication $\cdot$, satisfying

(addition)
- (commutativity) $a+b=b+a$
- (associativity) $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$
- (identity) there exists $0 \in k$ such that $a+0=a$ for all $a$
- (inverse) for every $a \in k$, there exists an additive inverse, denoted $-a$, such that $a+(-a)=0$

(multiplicaiton)
- (commutativity) $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
- (associativity) $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
- (distributivity over addition) $a\cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
- (identity) there exists $1 \in k$, $1 \neq 0$, such that $a \cdot 1 = a$ for all $a$
- (inverse) for every $a \in k$, $a \neq 0$, there exists a mutiplicative inverse, denoted $a^{-1}$, such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$.
