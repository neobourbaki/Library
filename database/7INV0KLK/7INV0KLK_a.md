Let $X$ and $Y$ be objects of a category $\mathcal{C}$. The *product* of $X$ and $Y$ is an object in $\mathcal{C}$, denoted $X \times Y$, together with morphisms $p_1: X \times Y \to X$ and $p_2: X \times Y \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$, that satisfies the universal property:

- for any object $Z$ in $\mathcal{C}$, and morphisms $f_1: Z \to X$ and $f_2: Z \to Y$, there exists a morphism $f: Z \to X \times Y$ such that $f_1 = p_1 \circ f$ and $f_2 = p_2 \circ f$.

In general, the *product* of a family of objects $X_i$, $i \in I$ is defined, and is denoted $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$.
