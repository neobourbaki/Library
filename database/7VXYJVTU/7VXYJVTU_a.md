The *projective space* $\mathbb{P}^n = \mathbb{P}_{k}^n$ over a field $k$ is the set of 1-dimensional subspaces of $k^{n+1}$, called the *points*. A *line* in $\mathbb{P}^n$ is a 2-dimenisional subspace of $k^{n+1}$, a *plane* a 3-dimensional subspace, etc., with the *incidence relation* on points, lines, planes, etc., given by containment of subspaces. We may regard a line (planes, etc.) as the set of points incident on it, and use the set notation $p \in L$ ($L \subset \pi$, etc.).
