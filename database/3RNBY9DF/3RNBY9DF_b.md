A *scheme* over a commutative ring $R$ is

- a topological space $X$,
- and a sheaf $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ of $R$-algebras on $X$,

such that for each $x \in X$, there exists an open set $U \subseteq X$ containing $x$ such that $(U, \mathcal{O}_{X}|_{U})$ is isomorphic to the spectrum of some $R$-algebra, and that the stalk of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ at $x$ is a local ring.
