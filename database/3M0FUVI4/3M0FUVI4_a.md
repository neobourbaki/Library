A subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ is *compact* if any open cover $\\{ U_i \\}_{i \in I}$, i.e. $U_i$ open in $X$, and $\bigcup_i U_i \supseteq S$, has a finite subcover, i.e., there exists a finite subset $J \subseteq I$ such that $\bigcup_{i in J} U_i \supseteq X$. 

A topological space $X$ is *compact* if it is compact as its own subset.
