A *curve* (or *path*) in a topological space $X$ is an equivalence class of continuous maps $\gamma: I \to X$ from an interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ to $X$, where $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$ if there is an increasing homeomorphism $\phi: I_1 \to I_2$ such that $\gamma_1 = \gamma_2 \circ \phi$. A representative $\gamma$ is called a *parametrization* of the curve.
