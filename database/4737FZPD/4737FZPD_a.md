A (continuous) *curve* in a topological space $X$ is an equivalence class of continuous maps $\gamma: I \to X$ from an interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ to $X$, where $\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$ if there is an increasing homeomorphism $\phi: I_1 \to I_2$ such that $\gamma_1 = \gamma_2 \circ \phi$. A representative $\gamma$ is called a *parametrization* of the curve.

If the interval $I$ is closed at both endpoints, i.e., $I = [a, b]$, then the curve is also called a *path* from $\gamma(a)$ to $\gamma(b)$. If, moreover, $\gamma(a) = \gamma(b) = x$, then it is also called a *loop* (based at $x$).
