A *power series* in a commutative ring $R$ centered at $x_0 \in R$ is a series in $R$ of the form

$$
\sum_{n \geq n_0} a_n (x - x_0)^n
$$

for each $x \in R$, with coefficients $a_n \in R$; in other words, a series in which the terms are powers of $x - x_0$.

The ring of power series is denoted $R[[x]]$ in the case that all $n_0 \geq 0$, and $R{{x}}$ in general.
