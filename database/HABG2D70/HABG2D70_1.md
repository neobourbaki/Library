The root system of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}(\mathbb{C})$ with respect to the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of diagonal matrices is

$$
\Phi = \\{ \varepsilon_i - \varepsilon_j \\,:\\, 1 \leq i \neq j \leq n \\} \subset \mathfrak{h}^*
$$

where $\varepsilon_i: \mathfrak{h}\to\mathbb{C}$ takes a diagonal matrix to its $i$-th diagonal entry, and the Weyl group $W$ is the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on $\mathfrak{h}^*$ by permuting the basis elements $\varepsilon_i$'s.
