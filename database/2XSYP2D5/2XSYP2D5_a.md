Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra over a field $F$, and $V$ and $W$ be representations of $g$ over some extension field $k/F$. The *tensor product* of $V$ and $W$ is the tensor product $V \otimes W$ as $k$-vector spaces, equipped with the action

$$
X (v \otimes w) = (Xv) \otimes (Xw)
$$

for $X \in \mathfrak{g}$, $v \in V$ and $w \in W$.
