A vector space $V$ over a field $k$ is *finite-dimensional* if it is finitely generated (as a $k$-module). In other words, it has a finite generating set, i.e., a subset $S \subset V$ such that the linear span of $S$

$$
\\{ \sum_{v_i \in S} \alpha_i v_i \\; : \\; \alpha_i \in k \\}
$$

is equal to $V$.
