A *finite-dimensional vector space* over a field $k$ is the set $k^n$ of $n$-tuples, called *vectors* and denoted $v = [v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n]$, of elements of $k$, equipped with addition and scalar multiplication:

- $v + w = [v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2, \ldots, v_n + w_n]$
- $\alpha v = [\alpha v_1, \alpha v_2, \ldots, \alpha v_n]$

for $v, w \in k^n$ and $\alpha \in k$.
