A *smooth* $n$-*manifold* is a subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that for any $x \in X$, there is a neighborhood $U \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ of $x$, an open subset $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and a smooth (i.e., infinitely differentiable) injective map $\phi: V \to \mathbb{R}^N$ such that $U \cap X$ is the image of $V$ under $\phi$, and the inverse $\phi^{-1}: U \cap X \to V$ is smooth, hence a diffeomorphism.
