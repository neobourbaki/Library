A *smooth manifold* of dimension $n$ is a topological $n$-manifold $M$ such that, for any two coordinate charts $\varphi_i: U_i \to V_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\varpsi_j: U_j \to V_j \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, the transition map $\varphi_i \circ \varpsi_j^{-1}$ is infinitely differentiable (smooth) on the overlap $\varpsi_j(U_i \cap U_j)$.
