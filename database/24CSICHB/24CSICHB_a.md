A *smooth manifold* of dimension $n$ is a topological $n$-manifold $M$ for which any two coordinate charts $\varphi_i: U_i \to V_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\varphi_j: U_j \to V_j \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, the transition map $\varphi_i \circ \varphi_j^{-1}$ is infinitely differentiable (smooth) on the overlap.
