The *free module* on a set $I$ (or generated by $I$) over a ring $R$ is the set $R^{\oplus I}$ of formal finite sums

$$
\sum_{i \in I} a_i e_i
$$

where $a_i \in R$, all but finitely many of which are zero. It is a $R$-module under the natural addition and multiplication by elements of $R$. A $R$-module is *free* if it is isomorphic to $R^{\oplus I}$ for some set $I$.
