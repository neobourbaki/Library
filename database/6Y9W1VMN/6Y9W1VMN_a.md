A *series* in a commutative ring $R$ is a (formal) expression

$$
\sum_{n=n_0}^{\infty} x_n \qquad \text{or} \qquad \sum_{n \geq n_0} x_n
$$

where $x_n \in R$ for each $n \geq n_0$. Formally, it is nothing but a map $\mathbb{Z} \to R$ that is zero for all $n < n_0$, with $x_n$ denoting the image of $n$.
