The Weyl group of a semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ is the group of linear maps on $\mathfrak{h}$ generated by reflections 

$$
s_\alpha (X) := X - \langle \alpha, X \rangle \alpha^{\vee}
$$

associated to the roots $\alpha$ of the root system $\Phi\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$.
