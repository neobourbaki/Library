The matrix multiplication is associative, and the identity is the identity matrix. It remains to be shown that multiplicative inverse exists.

If $k$ is a field, the inverse matrix of any matrix $A$ is defined (over $k$), and $\det(A^{-1}) = \det(A)^{-1} = 1$. In general, the inverse matrix is defined over a field containing $k$, but each entry is of the form of an element in $k$ divided by $\det A = 1$, hence is in fact over $k$.
