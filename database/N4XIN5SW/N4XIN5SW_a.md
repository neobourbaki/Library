The matrix multiplication is associative, and $\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)$ shows that $\mathrm{SL}_n(k)$ is closed under multiplication, with the identity being the identity matrix. The inverse $A^{-1}$ of any $A \in \mathrm{SL}_n(k)$ exists, and

$$
\det(A^{-1}) = \det(A)^{-1} = 1,
$$

hence $A^{-1} \in \mathrm{SL}_n(k)$.
