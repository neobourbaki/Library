The *direct sum* of vector spaces $V$ and $W$ over a field $k$ is the Cartesian product $V \times W$, together with addition and scalar multiplication

- $(v, w) + (v', w') = (v + v', w + w')$
- $\alpha(v, w) = (\alpha v, \alpha w)$

for all $v, v' \in V$, $w, w' \in W$, and $\alpha \in k$. It is often denoted $V \oplus W$.
